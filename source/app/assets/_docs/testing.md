# Brunch: Testing

<div class="toc-placeholder"></div>

## Unit testing

The curren options for unit testing are:

* use your built bundle from `public` in node
* run unit tests in the browser

Currently, there is no way to run unit tests directly on node, but...
A better approach is in the works. ðŸš§ 

## Integration testing

For integration testing in the browser, there are no additional steps required.

This simple function will load all your files that are ending with the `-test` suffix (`user-view-test.coffee` etc).

```javascript
window.require.list()
  .filter(function(name) {return /-test$/.test(name);})
  .forEach(require);
```
