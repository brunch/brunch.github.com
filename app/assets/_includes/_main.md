Installation is one-line, once you have
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). In your console, run:

    npm install -g brunch

## Getting started

#### Create a new Brunch project:

    brunch new [dir] [--skeleton url]

`skeleton` specifies a [skeleton](/skeletons) from which your application will be initialized. The default structure doesn't have any opinions about frameworks or libraries.

See the [README](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/master/docs/README.md) for a complete description of app structure.

#### Develop with Brunch:

    brunch watch --server

tells Brunch to watch your project and incrementally rebuild it when source files are changed. The optional `server` flag launches a simple web server with [push state](http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html) support.

If you use OS X and want brunch to show system notification every time compilation error happens, you will need to install [terminal notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier): `[sudo] brew install terminal-notifier`.

#### Build with Brunch:

    brunch build --production

builds a project for distribution. The optional `production` flag enables minification.

## A Quick Demo

See the <a href="http://vimeo.com/61056660">video that shows starting new app with Brunch</a>:

<h2>Deploying</h2>

<p>
  Brunch-generated applications are a bunch of simple static files. You can
  host them everywhere, even on free hostings, like
  <a href="http://help.github.com/pages/">GitHub pages</a>.

  Because production environments are usually
  slightly different than development envs,
  brunch has <code>optimize</code> option.
</p>

<p>To build application that has minified JS and CSS, execute <code>brunch build --optimize</code>. Then you can deploy it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you use <strong>static hosting site</strong>: build your application
    at your machine and just upload <code>public/</code>
    directory to the directory that is served by a webserver.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you use <strong>hosting that supports node.js</strong>, you can
    install brunch there and auto-build app every time.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you prefer <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>,
    there is <a href="https://gist.github.com/3596447">a nice small guide</a>
    on deploying.
    Should work even on free instances.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you’re into
    <a href="http://help.github.com/pages/">GitHub pages</a>,
    you’ll need to build your app,
    move <code>public/</code> directory to somewhere,
    <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">switch to <code>gh-pages</code>
    git branch</a>,
    remove files from directory and move files from your temporary
    dir here.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>All docs are available <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/tree/master/docs">on GitHub</a>. Also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/wiki/Examples,-articles-and-tutorials">articles, tutorials and talks</a>.</p>

<p>
  Brunch is similar to <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>, LiveReload and CodeKit.
  And it’s also different.
</p>

<p>LiveReload and CodeKit partly resemble Brunch compilation pipeline, file watching and auto reloading, but they don’t support advanced features like modules, Bower support or source maps generation</p>

<p>Grunt task manager is in some ways more flexible than Brunch, but its flexibility and explicitness can quickly become complexity.</p>
